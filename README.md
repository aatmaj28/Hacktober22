# Hacktober22

A Front-end Website for Hacktoberfest 2022 is a project by me, where me and my team was responsible for organizing the event at our college. The website serves as a platform for participants to submit pull requests and contribute to open source projects. Join us in fostering a vibrant open-source community by making valuable contributions and celebrating the spirit of Hacktoberfest.
